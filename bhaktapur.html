            <h1>Bhaktapur</h1>
            <p> City of Devotees - Bhaktapur is a treasure trove of artistic creations displayed on the temples and
                monuments of the city.
                Perched on a hill at an altitude of 1,401 m, Bhaktapur or Bhadgaon, literally the City of Devotees, is a
                major tourist destination that takes visitors back in time. Bhaktapur lies 12 km to the east of
                Kathmandu on the Arniko Highway that leads to the Chinese border. Covering an area of 6.4 sq km,
                Bhaktapur has managed to retain its authentic ambiance with brick-paved roads, charming red brick houses
                and a way of life that goes back to medieval times. This ancient city is also famous for pottery and
                woodcarving amply displayed on the squares and windows of the local houses and temples.

                BHAKTAPUR DURBAR SQUARE (UNESCO World Heritage Site): Bhaktapur Durbar Square is an elegant and open
                space facing south surrounded by buildings dating from the 13th century to the 18th century. The 15th
                century Palace of 55 Carved Windows called Pachpanna Jhyale Durbar and the palace entrance, the Golden
                Gate - a masterpiece in repoussé art, have added splendor to this palace square. The extraordinary
                Durbar Square with its extraordinary monuments reflects the glory days of the Malla dynasty when art and
                architecture thrived in the three cities of the valley.

                In front of the palace, building are innumerable temples and architectural showpieces like the Lion
                Gate, the statue of King Bhupatindra Malla mounted on a giant stone pillar and the Batsala Temple. The
                stone temple of Batsala Devi is full of intricate carvings and is a beautiful example of Shikhara-style
                architecture. There is a bronze bell on the terrace of the temple, which is also known as the Bell of
                Barking Dogs. Erected by King Ranjit Malla in 1737, its sounding announced the beginning and end of a
                daily curfew.

                NYATAPOLA TEMPLE: The unique temple of Bhaktapur, the Nyatapola literally means ‘five storied’ and rises
                above the city’s landscape as a remarkable landmark. It also has the distinction of having withstood the
                devastating earthquake of 1933. Dedicated to a Tantric goddess, the steps leading up to the temple are
                flanked by stone sculptures of deities and mythical beasts, each 10 times more powerful than the one
                immediately below.
                .
                BHAIRAVNATH TEMPLE: Dedicated to Bhairav, the God of Terror, the three-storied temple of Bhairavnath has
                only the head of Bhairav in the inner sanctum. Legend has it that the Bhairav’s head was cut off by a
                Tantric expert in order to keep him in Bhaktapur. Built-in pagoda style, the temple is noted for its
                artistic grandeur and stands adjacent to the famous five-storied Nyatapola Temple.

                DATTATREYA SQUARE takes its name from the Dattatreya Temple dedicated to a three-headed combination of
                the Hindu deities Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. This temple is said to have been built from the trunk of a
                single tree. Near this temple is a monastery with exquisitely carved peacock windows.

                SIDDHA POKHARI: For a small city, Bhaktapur has the largest number of public water tanks built within
                the city limits. Siddha Pokhari, which dates back to the Lichhavi period, is situated at the bus stop.
                This large rectangular pond teems with fish and has stone images of different Hindu and Buddhist deities
                on the walls surrounding it.

                THIMI is a Newar town situated about 8 km east of Kathmandu on the way to Bhaktapur. Besides farming,
                most of the households here are engaged in pottery. This laid-back town not only supplies Kathmandu its
                pottery but also its vegetables. The two important deities here are those of Balkumari Temple, dedicated
                to the Mother Goddess, and Karunamaya, the Buddha of Compassion.

                SURYA BINAYAK: The temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Ganesh. Situated in a thick forest to the south
                of Bhaktapur, it is a 20-minute walk from the bus stop. The temple is crowded with devotees especially
                on Tuesdays and Saturdays.

                CHANGU NARAYAN TEMPLE (World Heritage Monument): It is situated on a ridge overlooking Bhaktapur, about
                12 km to the east of Kathmandu. Dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu, it is one of the oldest specimens of
                pagoda architecture in the valley. The temple dating from the Licchavi period is embellished with
                exquisite wood and stone carvings. </p>
